## What Is System Restore?
 
System Restore is a tool that creates snapshots of your system files, settings, and drivers at regular intervals or before you make major changes to your system. These snapshots are called restore points. You can use System Restore to restore your system to any of the available restore points, undoing any changes that have occurred since then.
 
System Restore does not affect your personal files, such as documents, photos, or music. However, it may remove or restore some programs and drivers that you have installed or uninstalled after the restore point was created. Therefore, you should always back up your important data before using System Restore.
