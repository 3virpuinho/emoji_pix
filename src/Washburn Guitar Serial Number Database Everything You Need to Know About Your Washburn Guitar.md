# How to Find Out When Your Washburn Guitar Was Made
 
If you own a Washburn guitar, you may be curious about when it was manufactured. Maybe you want to know more about its history, or maybe you want to sell it or insure it. Whatever the reason, finding out the age of your guitar can be a fun and rewarding experience.
 
One of the easiest ways to date your Washburn guitar is by using its serial number. The serial number can be found in the sound hole of the acoustic or on the back of the headstock on electrics[^1^] [^2^]. In most cases\*\*, the first two numbers of the serial number are the year of manufacture. For example, if your guitarâs serial number is 94000000, your guitar was made in 1994[^1^] [^2^].

However, some Washburn serial numbers are more complicated than others. Washburn has used many serial number formats over the years, ranging from 4-12 characters long[^2^]. The year of manufacture can also be deduced from other features of the guitar, such as the logo, the shape, the hardware, or the model name. For example, some Washburn models have a âWâ prefix in their serial numbers, indicating that they were made in Japan by Yamaki[^2^].
 
If you are having trouble identifying your Washburn guitar by its serial number, you can also use online resources to help you. There are websites that offer guitar serial number lookup decoders for various brands, including Washburn[^3^]. You can also visit the Washburn website and browse their guitar archives, where you can find catalogs, pricelists, and specifications for different models and years[^2^]. You can also contact Washburn customer service and ask for assistance.

## How to Care for Your Washburn Guitar
 
Once you have dated your Washburn guitar, you may want to know how to keep it in good shape and prolong its lifespan. Proper guitar care and maintenance can make a big difference in how your guitar looks, sounds, and feels. Here are some tips on how to care for your Washburn guitar:
 
- Clean your guitar regularly. Dust, dirt, sweat, and oils can accumulate on your guitar over time and affect its appearance and performance. You can simply take a soft cloth and gently wipe the guitar down on all sides, up the neck, and even go over the strings and the tuning machines[^4^]. You can also use a guitar polish or cleaner designed for guitars to remove any stubborn grime or fingerprints. Avoid using household cleaners or abrasive materials that may damage the finish or the wood.
- Condition your fretboard. The fretboard is one of the most important parts of your guitar, as it is where you press the strings to create different notes. The fretboard can become dry or dirty over time, especially if it is made of unfinished wood like rosewood or ebony. To prevent cracking or warping, you should condition your fretboard periodically with a product like lemon oil or fretboard conditioner[^1^] [^2^]. Apply a small amount of the product to a cloth and rub it into the wood, then wipe off any excess. Do this whenever you change your strings or notice any signs of dryness.
- Humidify your guitar. Humidity or lack thereof can be any musical instrument's biggest enemy. It is important to regulate as best you can the relative humidity that surrounds the instrument. 45%-55% relative humidity is optimal[^1^] [^2^]. There are products available at any musical instrument store to help regulate humidity, such as humidifiers, hygrometers, or humidipaks. Never store the instrument by an outside wall/window or heating/AC vent. If an instrument becomes too dry, then the guitar will experience neck shrinkage and the frets will begin to feel sharp along the neck. If an instrument becomes too humid, then the guitar will experience swelling and possible glue joint failure[^1^]. For Washburn owners that reside in a dry climate, we recommend storing the instrument in a good quality hard shell case with a small guitar case humidifier[^3^].
- Change your strings. Guitar strings should be changed frequently- at least 4 times a year[^1^]. They become dirty and corrode over time, and lose their ability to maintain proper tuning. It is always best to be proactive about changing guitar strings- don't wait until you break one! Washburn's ship with light-gauge D'addario strings, though most acoustic instruments can accept any standard acoustic guitar string gauge[^1^]. To change your strings, you will need a string winder, a wire cutter, and a tuner. Follow these steps:
    1. Loosen the old strings with the string winder and remove them from the bridge and the tuning pegs.
    2. Clean and condition your fretboard as described above.
    3. Insert the ball end of the new string into the bridge pin hole and secure it with the bridge pin. Make sure the groove of the pin matches the string.
    4. Thread the other end of the string through the hole in the tuning peg and pull it tight.
    5. Wind the string around the peg with the string winder, making sure it goes over itself on the first wrap and under itself on subsequent wraps.
    6. Cut off any excess string with the wire cutter.
    7. Repeat for all six strings.
    8. Tune your guitar with the tuner and stretch the strings by gently pulling them away from the fretboard.
    9. Retune your guitar until it stays in tune.

By following these tips, you can ensure that your Washburn guitar stays in great condition for years to come. Remember to always handle your guitar with care and respect, and enjoy playing it!
