### How to Create Your Own Skins for Virtual DJ Pro 7.0
 
If you are feeling creative and want to make your own skins for Virtual DJ Pro 7.0, you can do so with some basic tools and skills. You will need a graphics editor program, such as Photoshop or GIMP, and a text editor program, such as Notepad or Sublime Text.
